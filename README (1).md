📊 Exciting Update from my Data Analyst Internship Project! 📈

I'm thrilled to share some highlights from my second project during my Data Analyst internship. 🎓

**Dataset Source**: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

**Objective:** To diagnostically predict diabetes based on key diagnostic measurements.

🔍 **Key Insights:**
- 🙋‍♀️ Our dataset focuses on Pima Indian heritage females, all aged at least 21.
- 📊 We harnessed the power of Power BI to visualize our findings, translating data into actionable insights.

📈 **Insights in this Dashboard:**
1. 🤰 The dataset contains a total of 768 pregnancies.
2. 🩺 We analyzed the average Blood Pressure (B.P) by age group.
3. 🧴 Explored the average Body Mass Index (BMI) by age group.
4. 💉 Studied the average Insulin levels by outcome.
5. 🍬 Examined the average Glucose levels by age group.
6. 👩‍⚕️ Discovered that out of 230 women suffering from diabetes, 192 had pregnancies, while 38 were non-pregnant.

It's incredible how data can reveal such meaningful insights that contribute to our understanding of health and well-being. 📊💡

I'm grateful for the opportunity to work on this project, and I can't wait to keep learning and growing in the world of data analytics. 🚀
